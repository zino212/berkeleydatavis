## User

general public without professional knowledge but basic experience in reading graphs  

## Context

online (e.g. in a website) with interaction  

## Task

visualizing global warming in a understandable and convincing way  
impressing people with objective evidence  

## Purpose

raising awareness for climate crisis

## Data

1750/1850 - today  
tables in .txt-files  


## Design relationales


- bar chart  
each bar stands for a year  
the height of bars stands for the value of temperature   
bars to print colors

- colors for temperature difference  
red-warm/blue-cold impression, supported by studies*

- drop down menu for different countries and continents (continents NYI)  
one country/continent at a time, no blend out - destroy the color stripes

- tooltip information for values  
for people who want more precision

- reference and explanation for data (NYI)  
to keep convincing and understandable

## Info Page

- What does temperature anomaly mean?  

A temperature anomaly is the difference from the average (baseline) temperature. We use the averaged absolute temperatures between Jan 1951 and Dec 1980 as the baseline temperature. A positive anomaly indicates the observed temperature was warmer than the baseline (with red color), while a negative anomaly indicates the observed temperature was cooler than the baseline (with blue color).

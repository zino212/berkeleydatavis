### Overview (Landing Page)

* Erklärung des allgemeinen Problems (Klimawandel)
* Erklärng, dass die Temperaturen steigen
* Einstieg insgesamt  
Global warming has been observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900). Although there were different periods of climate change in the history of the earth, the current changes are not simply due to natural causes. It is a global problem and affects people in different countries differently.

### Overview (Die große Übersicht):

* Tooltip angucken und ggf. verbessern
* Erklärung der Visualisierung  
Each row represents the temperate change of one country since 1961. Blue colors represent a temperate lower than the baseline temperature, while red colors represent a temperate higher than the baseline temperature. The baseline temperature is the average of the absolute temperatures between Jan 1951 and Dec 1980 in each country.

### Detailview:

* Erklärung der Visualisierung allgemein  
This is a colored bar chart. The height of the bars represent the differene between observed temperature and the baseline temperate. A blue bar means a temperate lower than the baseline temperature, while a red bar means a temperate higher than the baseline temperature. The baseline temperature is the average of the absolute temperatures between Jan 1951 and Dec 1980 in this country.

* Anomaly  
A temperature anomaly is the difference from the average (baseline) temperature. We use the averaged absolute temperatures between Jan 1951 and Dec 1980 as the baseline temperature. A positive anomaly indicates the observed temperature was warmer than the baseline (with red color), while a negative anomaly indicates the observed temperature was cooler than the baseline (with blue color).

* Uncertainty  
The temperatures from Berkeley Earth are observed from a large collection of weather monitoring stations. These stations are located in different areas all around the country, so they have different trends and baselines. The uncertainty represents the 95% confidence interval for statistical noise and spatial undersampling effects.  

### FAQ

* Data Source  
The dataset of this visualization is derived from Berkeley Earth, which is a non-profit organization focused on data science regarding the environment. In this dataset there are multiple tables with lists of temperature anomalies over a timespan from 1750 to 2020.
